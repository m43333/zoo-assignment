      The wallaby is a herbivorous marsupial native to Australia and nearby islands, 
      commonly found in habitats ranging from dense forests and rocky hillsides to open grasslands and coastal heaths. 
      It is closely related to the kangaroo, though generally smaller in size, and belongs to the family Macropodidae. 
      Wallabies use their powerful hind legs and long tails for hopping movement and balance across varied terrain. 
      They are primarily crepuscular, feeding on grasses, leaves, and other vegetation during dawn and dusk. 
      Female wallabies carry their young, called joeys, in forward-facing pouches until they are mature enough to emerge. 
      While many species are common, some face threats from habitat loss, invasive predators, and competition with livestock.
