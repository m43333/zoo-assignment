        The tapir is a large, herbivorous mammal native to the jungles and forests of Central and South America, 
        with one species also found in Southeast Asia. 
        It is most closely related to horses and rhinoceroses, and is recognized by its prehensile snout, 
        which it uses to grab leaves, fruit, and aquatic vegetation. 
        Tapirs are generally solitary and shy, often active at night and near water sources, 
        where they can swim and dive to escape predators or cool off. 
        Their thick hides offer some protection from jaguars, crocodiles, and other natural threats. 
        Due to habitat destruction, hunting, and low reproductive rates, several tapir species are currently considered vulnerable or endangered.
