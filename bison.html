        The bison is a large, herbivorous hoofed mammal native to North America and parts of Europe, 
        commonly found in grasslands, prairies, and open woodlands. 
        It is characterized by a massive head, humped shoulders, and a thick coat that varies with the seasons. 
        Bison travel in herds and graze on grasses, using their strong neck muscles to push aside snow in winter for food. 
        Once numbering in the tens of millions, bison populations were decimated by overhunting and habitat loss in the 19th century. 
        Conservation efforts have since helped restore some herds, particularly in protected reserves and national parks. 
        Despite their size, bison can run at high speeds and are known for their unpredictable and sometimes aggressive behavior when threatened.
